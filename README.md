This repo is about CMPE351 Term project, which topic is a CPU Scheduling report. 
The program is written in C++ programming language and runs on Linux Servers

ALL the necessary codes are in the cpe351.cpp file. ALL the FUCNTIONS implemented are working.

In order to compile the program please type: g++ cpe351.cpp -o cpe351
(the cpe351 at the end is AN EXAMPLE you can give ANY NAME you want to the file to run)

When you run the file make sure you are in the directory where you compiled 
then use this sample syntax: ./cpe351 -f input.txt -o output.txt (if the input file is not in the same directory give the correct path)
(The program has validation and will MAKE SURE that the 1st ARGUMENT -f is for the file to read from, and 2nd ARGUMENT -o for the file to write to)
